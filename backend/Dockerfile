# Yes, this Dockerfile is generally OK for a Node.js backend app.
# Here are a few suggestions for best practices and clarity:

FROM node:20.19.0

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only package files first for better layer caching
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

# Use "npm run start" or "npm run prod" depending on your scripts
CMD [ "npm", "run", "prod" ]
